			This is a networking certification from Google Cloud.
			It stands for Associate Cloud Engineer.
			I got this for my job at Revature(They got rid of me because they didn't enough clients who use Google Cloud Platform).
			My certifications expires December 2021.
			I remember being impressed by how well written it is.
			I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to talk about the specific content of the Exam and my name being on the website makes my fear of being sued more realistic.

			This is a java certification.
			It stands for Oracle Certified Associate.
			I was studying and thinking about taking this before COVID19 and it's the next certification on my list of certifications to get.
			I'm probably going to start studying for it again once, I'm done improving this website because there aren't any large projects I want to work on in immediate future and I think it's more important than small projects.
