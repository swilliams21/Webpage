			Escape the Tower
		</div>
		<div class="itemdes">
			This was a semester long academic group project.
			The language for the project was java.
			The goal was to create a text based adventure game using MVC architecture.
			The tower had 30 rooms, several enemy types, and a few puzzles.
			My main responsibilities were setting up the controller part of the MVC and reading/writing from a textfile to load or save the game. I also implemented the rooms and helped bug fix other features that had errors.
		</div>
		<div class="conclusion">
			Full Scope complete<br>
			A on the project<br>
			3/4 of the group members were new to object oriented programming and had schedules outside of school.<br>

			Email Guard
		</div>
		<div class="itemdes">
			This was a semester long academic group project.
			Javascript was the main language. 
			The original scope was to implement a warning system for emails that contain profane language. 
			With the original scope email guard would scan an email and send a warning that required a confirmation to send the email if it detected any bad words.
			We had to change the scope because one of the requirements was that it had to be distributable and Microsoft had a policy.
			The new scope was to have a clickable button that displayed which words were swears.
			I messed with the project manifest to get the button to work and 33ish% of the button functionality.
			I was also responsible for the list of swears.
			Most of this project was bug fixing and research which was a collaborative effort.
			
		</div>
		<div class="conclusion">
			Original Scope was invalid<br>
			Alternate Scope complete<br>
			A on the project do to good explanation for alternate scope and ok documentation on Jira.<br>
			We could not complete the original scope because Microsoft has a policy prevented people from uploading addins to outlook that override the onsend feature.<br>
			I can't link the repository because private repo.

			StarcraftAI
		</div>
		<div class="itemdes">
			This was a semest long academic group project.
			Python was the main language.
			The scope was to implement feature for a bot that played starcraft2. 
			Blizzard released api for doing bot games and bot makers made api around that api that makes making a bot to play starcraft2 relatively easy.
			There is a website for bot tournaments(<a href="https://sc2ai.net/">https://sc2ai.net/</a>).
			There is a discord server for bot makers(<a href="https://discord.com/invite/zXHU4wM">https://discord.com/invite/zXHU4wM</a>).
			Our group was 3 member and there are three playable factions in the game and I was in charge of the Terran Faction.
			I focused on making a good Terran bot and implemented as many features as I could.
		</div>
		<div class="conclusion">
			Original Scope 95% complete<br>
			A on the project because of very good documentation on Jira and most features implemented on Jira.<br>
			I never did tournament or bot ladder but I did manage to create a Terran bot that beat elite(highest level AI from Blizzard) in a best of 5.
			The project is in a state where it could be a good hobby if I chose to pursue it.<br>
			The API used was in a not good place last time I checked. To get it to work, I would have to redownload from the dev branch.<br>

			Circle Game.
		</div>
		<div class="itemdes">
			This was a non-academic Hobby Project.
			CSS was the main language used. The project used the unity engine to create a phone game.
			The scope was to expirament with Google Play. 
			The game is a simplistic circle game.
		</div>
		<div class="conclusion">
			Orginal Scope successful but dissapointing<br>
			I chose android version 4 for the target api and it works and downloads on my 6.0.1 android phone. One of my internet friends stated that it wouldn't let him download it from play store on his version 8 android phone. Research determined revealed that newer devices aren't compatible with old api versions.<br>
			The process of creating and deploying a simple phone game took almost 2 weeks mostly because of having to go through a less than 1 week review process twice.
			If I were to do another android project, I would have to worry about compatibility and marketing.

			Salad Quest
		</div>
		<div class="itemdes">
			This was a non-academic Hobby Project.
			Main language was java/processing3.
			The scope was proof of concept for a non-game engine game. 
			I made a terrible mario clone platformer called salad quest that used processing3 for graphics.
		</div>
		<div class="conclusion">
			Original Scope successful but dissapointing<br>
			The proof of concept was successful but I was working with unity for smaller projects at the same time and found that it was so much simpler just to use a game engine.

			This is a Non-academic semi-professional project.
			It's literally this.
			I'm making a website to be more professional.
		</div>
		<div class="conclusion">
			Original Scope in progress<br>
			It's still in progress and I'd like to add more features and improve the css.<br>
			The pattern suggests I should leave repo or other link but I'd hate to have something link to itself.
