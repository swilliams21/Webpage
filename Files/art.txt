			Current Artistic Goals
		</div>
		<div class="itemdes">
			I'm currently taking a break from most art.
			I bet my friend I could make a better DnD clone, so my creative vision is consumed by that at the moment.
			I grossly undestimated the amount of work required for it.
			Most of my art is on instagram.

			Salad Art
		</div>
		<div class="itemdes">
			I did a lot of food art. Most of my food art are salads.
			I like salad art because it's simple and I can focus on small details.
			Most of the skill for salad art would be picking an angle, composition, lighting, and rotation.
			It's weirdly satifying art.

			Satirical Noire Art
		</div>
		<div class="itemdes">
			I like to make satire art based on how I view Noire.
			There's not a lot of it, but it's some of my favorite art.

			Item focus art
		</div>
		<div class="itemdes">
			I like to take pictures of random items that are isolated.
			The rule for item focus art, is that I am not allowed to create or change it.
			It's pretty much just me taking pictures of trash outside and putting it on instagram.
