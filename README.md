The website was initially deployed through a .jar but that deployment was insufficient. It's currently being hosted as static html. The .jar is currently not being updated but it is here if I need to change the website to include a properly utilized backend. Ignore the travis file. I was going to do a CI or CD pipeline but decided I would prefer to manually deploy.
